From **Github**:

```sh
$ npm install GochoMugo/node-telegram-bot-api
```

From **npm**:

```sh
$ npm install node-telegram-bot-api-latest    # note the '-latest' suffix
```

**Note:** If you use **npm**, you'll have to `require("node-telegram-bot-api-latest")`
(note the -latest suffix) instead, since it is a different package. Otherwise,
keep using `require("node-telegram-bot-api")` as if it is the original package.
